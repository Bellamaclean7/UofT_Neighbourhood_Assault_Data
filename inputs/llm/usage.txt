My graphs are looking great however only some of the graphs are showing the year across the x-axis and I need them all to show the year. here is the code and I have attached a picture of my graphs: 
```{r assault-rates-line-plot, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Your data preparation code
long_data <- all_neighbourhoods %>%
  gather(key = "Year", value = "Assault_Rate", -Neighbourhood) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_extract(Year, "\\d{4}")))

# Plot the graph with facets and without a legend
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Year, y = Assault_Rate, group = Neighbourhood, color = Neighbourhood)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Assault Rates in University of Toronto's Surrounding Neighbourhoods (2014-2023)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Assault Rate"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2014, to = 2023, by = 2)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Neighbourhood) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

In ggplot2, the x-axis labels for faceted plots are by default only shown on the bottom-most panels to avoid redundancy and clutter. However, you can override this behavior by using the scales = "free_x" argument within the facet_wrap() function. Doing this tells ggplot2 to treat each facet's x-axis independently, which allows each facet to have its own set of x-axis labels.

Here's the updated code that should allow all facets to show the year on the x-axis:
```{r assault-rates-line-plot, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Your data preparation code
long_data <- all_neighbourhoods %>%
  gather(key = "Year", value = "Assault_Rate", -Neighbourhood) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_extract(Year, "\\d{4}")))

# Plot the graph with facets and without a legend
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Year, y = Assault_Rate, group = Neighbourhood, color = Neighbourhood)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Assault Rates in University of Toronto's Surrounding Neighbourhoods (2014-2023)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Assault Rate"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2014, to = 2023, by = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Neighbourhood, scales = "free_x") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none", # This line removes the legend
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

can I make my y-axis skip by two to make it more clean in R? Currently my y-axis = years (from 2014-2023) but the years are all so close together and it makes it hard to read so I want the axis to skip a year. I am working in an Rmarkdown file.

Yes, you can set the breaks to skip years to make the x-axis less cluttered. If you want to place a tick mark every two years, you can create a sequence that increments by two. Here's how you would modify the scale_x_continuous() function to achieve this:
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2014, to = 2023, by = 2))
This seq() function generates a sequence from 2014 to 2023 with steps of 2, resulting in tick marks for the years 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022. This should make your x-axis cleaner if you have many data points or if the labels are overlapping.

how do I reference my graph in my text?

In R Markdown, to reference a labeled figure or table, you use the syntax (\@ref(label)), where label is the label assigned to the figure or table.

Based on the label you provided for your table (tbl-cleaned_surrounding_neighbourhood_data), you would reference it in your text as follows:
(See Table \@ref(tbl-cleaned_surrounding_neighbourhood_data))
When you knit the document, this syntax will automatically convert to a clickable reference that takes the reader to the designated table, and the actual table number will be inserted in place of the reference code.

For example, in your narrative text, you might write:

"As demonstrated in the data (See Table @ref(tbl-cleaned_surrounding_neighbourhood_data)), there are noticeable differences in assault rates across various neighbourhoods..."

Make sure to keep the same label that you used in the chunk header for your table, and do not include any additional spaces within the parentheses or the reference code.

this piece of code is showing up in my pdf and I need to get rid of it:  [1] 0<ScaleContinuousPosition>Range:Limits:    0 --    1

ChatGPT

Generated by DALL路E
The line [1] 0<ScaleContinuousPosition>Range:Limits: 0 -- 1 is likely output from a ggplot2 function, possibly related to setting the scale limits (like ylim()) or a similar function that affects the scale. By default, R Markdown will display the results of code execution in the document.

To prevent this message from appearing in your PDF, you can set message=FALSE and warning=FALSE in the chunk options. Here is how you adjust the chunk header:
```{r your-chunk-name, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Your code here
